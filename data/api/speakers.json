We'll also discuss the Command Pattern, and how it can help keep your Flutter apps sufficiently decoupled and flexible. Lastly, we'll use our decoupled system to seamlessly add voice commands to the game, allowing players on mobile or mobile web to shout commands.",

For example, a Flutter desktop app, or a Flutter web app has a writing/editing feature along with the ability to save things. In this case ideally the common gesture to achieve this is Ctrl+S for “save”, Ctrl+A for “select all”,  Ctrl+C for “copy”, and so on. With Intents and Actions widget in Flutter, it is all possible with simplicity and minimum amount of code. This session will have most of its part as live coding stuff.",
